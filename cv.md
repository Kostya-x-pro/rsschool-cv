### ***About me:***
A little bit about yourself. I am 30. Graduated from the Belarusian-Russian University with a degree in engineering. After some time, I realized that this is not the area in which I would see prospects for myself. Over time, I learned about front-end developers and decided to try to learn this specialty.
I consider my strength to be purposefulness, even if something doesnâ€™t work out for me, I will not give up until the end. I also easily find a common language with almost any people, I have leadership qualities. My priorities in life are family and their well-being. And my goal is to achieve this, no matter what field or environment I am in. I give great importance to sports and an active lifestyle.
